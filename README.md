## 📈 About This Repository

The goal of this repository is simple: maintaining a GitHub contribution heatmap that is fully green 😅

As you know, recruiters sometimes look at GitHub activity, but when you work as a freelancer on other platforms like GitLab, or contribute to private repositories, your public GitHub profile doesn't always reflect your actual work. That's why I created this repository—to showcase my skills, share my professional profile in an accessible format, and maintain consistent GitHub activity through automated daily commits via CI/CD.

**Feel free to fork this if you're a freelancer facing the same challenge!** Have fun 😉
